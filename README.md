# Game dev sandbox using Node, Coffeescript and Pixi

For HTML5 game dev, I wanted a dev environment where I can design reasonably clean code using Coffeescript and node-style includes, modules and depedency management.

Assuming NodeJS and NPM are running on your system:

    $ npm install
    $ gulp

Your browser will launch, and any change to markup, code and styles are automatically sent to the browser.
